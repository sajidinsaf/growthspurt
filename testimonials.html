								My first interaction with Nandita was around 4 years back when I
								was nominated to a program on Leadership Development -by my
								organization. Nandita was the sole facilitator for the program.
								The one thing that stood out was her clarity of thoughts and the
								way she planned the event. She took particular pains to ensure
								that all participants were on the same page on subject she dwelt
								on. I still recall the couple of feed-backing sessions I had
								with her over phone and I realized how carefully she was
								listening to the progress I had made in my projects with
								pin-pointed suggestions on improvement areas. I must acknowledge
								that the learnings I had helped me to a great extent in
								progressing my career to the next level. <br /> Subsequently as
								a NSM, I sought her help to organize a series of workshops with
								select AMs who had aspirations to move up the organizational
								ladder- with a view to improve their skill-sets and shape their
								thought process. Here again, her contribution to the development
								of these chosen AMs was very impressive and as a NSM, I was able
								to see a significant improvement in the thought process of many
								of these AMs. During the course of these workshops, she had
								taken pains to do regular follow-up with AMs through telecons on
								progress made by them, post their class room training. My RBMs
								and AMs who have had an opportunity to work with her agree that
								she is down to earth, approachable, practical and very clear in
								her communications on her expectations from the trainees. Her
								follow-through post these trainings have been very impressive.
								Thanks to her interventions and help, we have seen a couple of
								AMs make it to the next grade in the last interview process. <br />

								We have also used Nandita’s services to run a couple of programs
								for our RBMs on Feedbacking . The program has been highly
								appreciated by all the stakeholders.

								I have had the pleasure of working with Nandita for several
								years now. What I like best about her is the desire to effect
								positive change. She is not for the superficial. The best way
								she accomplishes this is through her unshakeable focus on the
								participants in her workshops and journeys. She does a lot of
								hard work to understand their context, challenges and learning
								goals. And the when the delivery happens people have a sense of
								completion around it because they found it relevant and solution
								oriented. <br /> Nandita is also a sounding board. She brings
								in practicality and tried to blend theory and practice in a way
								that makes it easy for people to 'do' things. She helps me stay
								grounded in the 'doing' and thus stay close to what my teams
								will truly benefit from. <br /> She has been a great partner
								and I hope we will continue to find opportunities to do work
								together in the future.
