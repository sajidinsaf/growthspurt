        <p>I am an entrepreneur with 20 years of experience, both as a line manager and as an independent consultant. A major part of my career has been with the education industry where I started as an SBU Head, from where I moved to take on as the National Operations Manager and shortly thereafter, rose to head an independent business vertical. As a Divisional Head, my responsibilities included handling a P&L and introducing new revenue initiatives for the company.
        </p>
        <p>I currently head a boutique firm ‘Growth Spurt’ operating in the space of Organization Development. As an independent consultant, I have hugely benefitted from my front-line business experience. It has helped me understand specific business context / needs and then develop and deliver solutions that effectively address them. As a facilitator, I have been able to create relevance and value for the participants by sharing first-hand experience of handling tough business situations, team challenges etc.
        </p>
        <p>I have facilitated workshops and learning journeys for middle to senior management for a varied clientele spanning diverse sectors like Consumer durables, FMCG, BFSI, Pharma, Telecom, KPO, Manufacturing, Infrastructure Development etc. 
        </p>
        <p>I am passionate about facilitation and prefer using experiential and reflection based methodologies for a frank exchange of ideas. I believe that the impact of any learning initiative comes from its relevance and applicability to the participants and design my initiatives accordingly. I subscribe to the ‘have fun while you learn’ philosophy and believe in creating insights through sharing stories and examples.
        </p>
        <p>Apart from facilitating workshops, I also enjoy creating end to end solutions and have extensive experience in assessing training needs, designing, developing and implementing learning interventions for improving organisational health. I am an accredited MBTI practitioner and actively use it in my coaching assignments.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy travelling to different places to deliver workshops. It also gives me ideas for my other professional interest – freelance writing.
